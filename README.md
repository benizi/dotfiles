# Dotfiles

My dotfiles

# WARNING

Some of these files are amazingly old (pulled into SVN in 2008), and they go
back well beyond the point at which I understood what some of these files were
doing.

# But

That said, these are the files I'm currently using on a handful of personal and
work computers for configuring all kinds of things.

# Context

For a better idea of tools I currently use/like/understand, see [my ansible
scripts](https://github.com/benizi/config-ansible), which I'm building up as I
provision my most recent laptop (a ThinkPad X240).
