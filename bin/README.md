# Scripts of all sorts

This is a repo containing scripts I want installed in my ~/bin directory on new
systems.

# Buyer Beware

The scripts contained here have been collected over many years, at various
points in my development as a programmer in various languages.  They've
survived switching my home dir VCS from SVN (starting in ~2008) to Mercurial
(~2009) to git (~2010).
